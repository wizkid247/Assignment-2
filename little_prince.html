<p> As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
    <under>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</under>
    <high>It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. </high>
    In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind,
    and I said to myself: <textCol>"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</textCol>
    As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: <textCol>"What moves me so deeply,
    about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through
        his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</textCol> And I felt him to be more fragile still.
    <under>I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</under></p>
